;; TODO:

;; TODO: Diffview
;; - figure out what here is actually useful in various workflows
;;   e.g., code review, reviewing my PR before pushing it, debugging,
;;   finding a part of a changed file in my branch, etc
;; - hide the diffviewer tab / tabline (although maybe this is actually
;;   a good use of it?)
;;      - if hidden, then we need a hotkey to bounce between the diff
;;        view and the main tab
;; - if using Diffview, is there a way to stop it from messing up my
;;   <Leader> hotkeys?
;; - detect the error condition where `!git remote set-head...` hasn't
;;   been run and run it automatically against main or master

;; The idea would be that you turn the mode on (globally) and select the base.
;; Then whenever you enter a file, the reference is taken from that base as the
;; comparison point for mini.diff. Combine this with a way to jump between changed
;; files (list collect from `git status --short`), and you'll bounce between files
;; and they'll automatically have the diff calculated from the right point.

;; This can probably replace my desired usage of Diffview entierly.
