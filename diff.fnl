;; Diff

;; TODO:
;; - hotkeys for jumping to next/prev changed hunk
;; - view hunk diff at current line in pop-up (w/ yanking)
;; - picker for files that have changed from the base of the branch (and since
;;   the previous commit, and unstaged)

; (map :n "[C" "]c" {:noremap true :silent true :desc "Next change"})

;; TODO: Diffview
;; - figure out what here is actually useful in various workflows
;;   e.g., code review, reviewing my PR before pushing it, debugging,
;;   finding a part of a changed file in my branch, etc
;; - hide the diffviewer tab / tabline (although maybe this is actually
;;   a good use of it?)
;;      - if hidden, then we need a hotkey to bounce between the diff
;;        view and the main tab
;; - if using Diffview, is there a way to stop it from messing up my
;;   <Leader> hotkeys?
;; - detect the error condition where `!git remote set-head...` hasn't
;;   been run and run it automatically against main or master
